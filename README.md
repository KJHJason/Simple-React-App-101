# Simple React App 101

Decided to start learning react and followed a YouTube tutorial, [React Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=yaH9UYEWuW2U-MBJ), by Programming with Mosh to get started.

## Concepts I have learned

- Project Setup
  - Using `npm create vite@latest` to create a new react app
- React components and JSX
- Conditional rendering
- Props
- State/Hooks
